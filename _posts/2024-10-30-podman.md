Before diving into how to run podman inside of a container, let's understand what podman is and how it is different than docker.

## What is Podman?
Podman is a container engine similar to docker which can be used to create, manage, and run containers and container images. Podman supports running containers in both root and rootless modes, with a strong focus on security and integration with Linux’s security features like SELinux. 

You must be wondering what actually is pod in podman. Well, a pod is essentially a group of one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage, allowing them to work closely together as a single unit. A pod can contain one or more tightly coupled containers that need to communicate with each other. For example, in a web application, you might place a web server container and a sidecar container (such as one that logs requests) in the same pod. Podman manages these pods via a simple command-line interface (CLI) and the libpod library, which provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes.

Each pod is composed of 1 infra container and any number of regular containers. The infra container keeps the pod running and maintains user namespaces, which isolate containers from the host. The other containers each have a monitor to keep track of their processes and look out for dead containers―nonfunctioning containers that can’t be taken out of the environment because some of their resources are still being used.

### Namespaces in Linux
Namespaces are a kernel feature that provide a way to isolate and virtualize system resources for processes. By using namespaces, processes can have their own unique views of system resources, such as the filesystem, network interfaces, user IDs, and more. You can think of namespaces as vitual environments in your linux system. This isolation makes namespaces secure, isolated environments where multiple applications can run on a single system without interfering with each other. Now, you must have understood why namespaces are important in containerisation as it allow each container to run in a fully isolated environment. There are multiple types of linux namespaces such as Mount, Process ID, Network, Interprocess Communication, User, Time, etc. You can read more about these namespaces in the official documentation as this post deals mainly with podman :). 

## Podman vs Docker
Podman stands out from other container engines because it’s daemonless, meaning it doesn't rely on a process with root privileges to run containers.

Daemons are processes that run in the background of your system to do the work of running containers without a user interface. Think of daemons as the intermediary communicating between the user and the container itself. In Linux systems, the root account acts as a superuser with administrative access (while bypassing the need for admin verification) to read files, install programs, edit applications, and more. This makes daemons an ideal target for hackers who want to gain control of your containers and infiltrate the host system.

## How to use podman inside of a container
Podman can be run in multiple ways, rootful and rootless. The combinations can be:

- Rootful Podman in rootful Podman
- Rootless Podman in rootful Podman
- Rootful Podman in rootless Podman
- Rootless Podman in rootless Podman


In order to run a container engine like Podman within a container, the first thing you need to understand is that you need a fair amount of privilege.

- Containers require multiple UIDs. Most container images need more than one UID to work. For example, you might have an image with most of the files owned by root, but some owned by the apache user (UID=60).
- Container engines mount file systems and use the system call clone to create user namespaces.
